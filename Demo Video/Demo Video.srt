1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:16,000
The project name is "Sorcerer's Siege" and the project background is "In a kingdom full of magical and dangerous things, the players need to defend the kingdom as a magical role to avoid the barrages unleashed by the evil wizard."

2
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:31,000
And then this are the dangerous things such as fireball, iceball, magical ball, water ball, and snowball. And this is the player.

3
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:50,000
The CSV files with comma in their names will not be incorrectly identified when adding enemies. Entering enemy's speed will prompt an error if it is not a number or an integer.

4
00:00:50,000 --> 00:01:05,000
The game will not be able to identify the player.

5
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:20,000
The game will not be able to identify the player.

6
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:35,000
The game will not be able to identify the player.

7
00:01:35,000 --> 00:02:02,000
And add an edit or edit temporarily and are not written to the CSV file.

8
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:13,000
Click "Save" to write the file to the CSV file. Then "Delete" is "Delete".

9
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:21,000
This save is the standard for outstanding data persistence.

10
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Finish the program by clicking "Save" and open the "Enemies.csv" to show the enemies you just added called commas and double quotes.

11
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:56,000
These are double quotes and this is "a". And then start again to see that their names are displayed correctly.

12
00:02:56,000 --> 00:03:04,000
For enemy names, Speed Maps implements CRUD function with a graphical interface.

13
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:16,000
Then click "Start". Enter double quotes and commas in the name to prove the robustness of the code. Then enter decimals and letters in the velocity. A window will pop up.

14
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:30,000
After a few clicks on the drop-down box of the picture.

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Selecting this enemy is selecting the corresponding tile. Before clicking to start the game, enemies will randomly send a new one from the list of existing enemies.

16
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:52,000
Then what we have to do is manipulate the player to avoid the fireball, waterball, magic ball and so on.

17
00:03:52,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Then we click "Start Game".

18
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:26,000
And then this is "Restart Game"

19
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:42,000
We can also pause the game.

20
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:46,000
And then continue.

21
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Pause and continue.

22
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:06,000
If we meet the enemy, the game is over and we can see the score on the screen.

23
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:24,000
If the ball crosses the bottom line, it scores. And for every 10 points, the difficulty level increases by 1 level and enemies become faster.

24
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:52,000
And then this is the whole game.
